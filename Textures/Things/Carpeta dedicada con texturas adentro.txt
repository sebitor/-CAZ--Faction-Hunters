As you can see, we have multiple images for our item. Rimworld has a "stack system," and the image of an item updates depending on how many items are in the stack. You might have noticed this with potatoes ðŸ¥”. In Rimworld, If there is one potato on the ground, it only shows you 1 potato. If there are a few more potatoes, the game shows you a box of potatoes. The same is true of steel, beer, silver, and of course, drugs. That's why our images have an "_a" or "_b" at the end, _a is used for the smallest stack size, and _b will be used for larger stack sizes. We could even add a "_c" image for even larger stack sizes, but I'm lazy, so you get two.
